    <h2 id="s-history"> All 'bout Stickaia's HISTORY </h1>
    <ul>
        <li> 2017 - Founded with the first 2 members.
        It was called "Papaia" back then
        We did not make comics at that time.
        Instead, we just drew. </li>
        <li> 2018 - LOTS of people join, we reckon around 17 people in "Papaia" at peak.
        But then they dropped out leading to only a few left. </li>
        <li> 2019 - By now, too many were joining then leaving.
        We developed a test to see if they truely belonging in "Papaia".
        This filtered out some people,
        but the ones that made it in eventually stopped making comics. </li>
        <li> 2020 - A competitor called "Supercomix" came over and declared war.
        But we won in the end. If you want to know more, go to "The War of Comics"</li>
        <li> 2021 - We don't know why,
        but we foolishly combined Papaia and Supercomix into "Stickaia". 
        The memebers from Supercomix were quite useless,
        and instead of helping us, they cause disruptions</li>
        <li> Present - Not much is happening, we are ignoring Supercomix
        and planning to go back to just being Stickaia by ourselves,
        but we are giving Supercomix ONE more chance.</li> 
    </ul> 
    <h2 id="battle"> The War of Comics</h1>
    <h4> This war happened when Supercomix became a competitor in 2020.
    This long war wasn't violent, but very secretive. Supercomix sent spies over to trash our comics,
    we sent spies as well, betryal stunk in the air, and we even set up a public election on a busy hillside!
    We easily won as Supercomix's comics, well, didn't make much sense.
    People stopped supporting them, but we were also dropping out slowly.
    So we had this STUPID IDEA to make a collab company called Stickaia.
    But in our DEFENSE, we was a dumdum back then :/
    NOW WE DON'T DO SILLY THINGS LIKE SPEEL THINGZ INKOWECTLY (those spelling mistakes are not deliberate).</h4>
